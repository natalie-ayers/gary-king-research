LEXICOGRAPHICAL AND RHETORICAL COMMENTARY
Do what you must, and come what may (The signs of the author's individualization in LJ correspond to the communicative standard: a surname in Latin, an aphoristic slogan, an avatar and an email address. it is not known whether this is a real photograph of the author or an “image” one (Aleksey Kungurov)
Fedya, piss (vulg.) in your clearing! (THE HEADING IS POLEMICALLY DIRECTIONAL TO THE IN-CORRESPONDENT INTERVIEWER-ADDRESSER - THE OBJECT OF HARD CRITICISM, AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TEXT ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHOR TO THIS PERSON IN HIS LJ)

October 22 /2013/
The genre of publication in LiveJournal is a critical review with a declared anti-advertising goal - to turn potential viewers away from viewing in order to reduce the profit of the "project" and personally director F. Bondarchuk. Illustrations - 2 demotivators. The first of them is colored homoerotically and should reinforce the sharply negative image of F. Bondarchuk's character.

1. Today I was invited to the live broadcast of the TV channel "Komsomolskaya Pravda" to discuss the next film vyser (there is no verb in the dictionary; the infinitive is vulg.; to express what hurts) Bondarchuk "Stalingrad". But since the studio is located in Moscow, and I'm in Novosibirsk, it didn't work out (simple). Therefore, I state here what I would say if I got into the TV box (simple, neglected, TV). METATEXT SUBSTANTIATION OF THE TEXT - NEWS REASON "FAIL TO BE ON THE AIR"

2. The feelings that Bondarchuk's product * evokes in me - disgust for the *craft itself and disgust for its creators. And the accompanying PR hype causes a sharp annoyance. THESIS -1 NEGATIVE EVALUATION OF A FILM PRODUCT THROUGH FEELINGS IN ART LOGIC / TOPIC: CONTRASTING THE TRUE VALUES OF ART WITH THE FALSE VALUES OF CONSUMER
I explain why. METATEXT-DEMONSTRATION It is infuriating that primitive consumerism (not in the dictionary, occasionalism, “confusingly similar”, a sharply negative assessment of a market product. From consume + Gd + -IN- (suf. Abstr.) try to sell * ARGUMENT -1 IN THE FORM OF ANTITHETIC JUDGMENT But this is precisely consumerism - a product for the satisfaction of cattle hard work, while having a sense of the herd) the need for spectacle. HE GOES INTO ANTITHETIC THESIS 2 How is art different from consumerism? Art, in this case *, cinema art * - is something that requires mental effort, spiritual labor from the viewer. - just entertains. Art develops a person aesthetically, intellectually, morally (educates), * enriches emotionally; art is always higher than the one who addresses it, and sometimes it is higher even than its creator. To create a great work, on to jump above your head. In order to perceive it, one must, figuratively speaking, lift oneself out of the swamp by the hair (who did not understand the metaphor - read the adventures of Baron Munchausen). Consumerism is always focused not even on the average level of a potential buyer, but on the lowest possible level of development, because this *, and only this provides a wide target audience. ARGUMENTATION-2 TECHNICALLY - DIVISION, THROUGH A PARALLEL DETAILED CHARACTERISTIC OF CONTRAST PHENOMENA

3. Art is self-sufficient. It does not matter that Van Gogh could not sell his paintings during his lifetime, nor does it matter that now some fleeting sketch of his is being sold for millions of dollars. The works of Dürer and Rembrandt are not sold at all and, in principle, have no market quotation, and what (simple)? Consumption is a purely utilitarian phenomenon, there is a very specific criterion for its evaluation - the collected cash. If the costs are repaid (not in the dictionary, slang. Krim-econ., returned with a profit?) And the investors received a gesheft (simple, disapproved or ironic), then * the film project is successful, if they suffered a loss, then they removed the mess (slang .; lies, deceit, fake). ARGUMENTATION CONTINUED IN THE SAME SCHEME
4. Consumerism is a market product, art is not. Nightclubs and striptease bars only make sense if they are profitable. Libraries, museums and organ halls are not being called for to be abolished just on the grounds that they are unprofitable. Yes, there is a trend towards this, but so far such an idea is far from becoming mainstream. Consequently, even in a rapidly degrading (dehumanizing) society, there remains the possibility of preserving the spiritual and intellectual potential accumulated by mankind. If anyone finds it difficult to understand the meaning of the word "dehumanization", then I will explain it more simply - this is a global process of turning a thinking and creative person into a member of a consumer society, in which the status of an individual in the social hierarchy is determined solely by the volume of material goods consumed by him: you drive a Bentley and play exchange - it means * If the costs are repaid (not in the dictionary, slang. Krim-econ., returned with a profit?) And the investors received a gesheft (simple, disapproved or ironic), then * the film project is successful, if they suffered a loss, it means they removed the crap (slang; lies, deceit, fake). CONTINUED ARGUMENTATION ACCORDING TO THE SAME SCHEME, PLUS THESIS-3 ABOUT DEHUMANIZATION, PLUS TOPOS "MAN", ALSO IN CONTRAST.
5. So, the product of Fedka Bondarchuk is a primitive consumer product designed for degenerates. I do not exclude that he will be able to cut down the loot (slang, get money) on his hack (simple, side income, work//bad work). CONCLUSION - CONFIRMATION And all this rotten fuss in show business would not bother me at all, if not for two points. METATEXT - REFLECTION OF EMOTIONS AND ENTRY TO A NEW LEVEL OF ARGUMENTATION First - Fedka, a bitch (rude-simple, abusive), got into my pocket, that is, blinded his shit (rude-simple, worthless, trashy, nonsense) with budget money . Engage in perversions at your own expense, there will be no complaints. And secondly, and most importantly, the bald degenerate loudly, greedily and smelly shit (vulg., to do something nasty, to spoil kl) into my spiritual well. After that, helpless arguments like "don't like it - don't look" won't work anymore (slang, pass for someone// approach, be by the way). Hey * (simple) you, glamorous-cocaine schmuck (jarg., stupid, dirty, morally degraded ch-k, causing contempt of others (INVECTIVE, BABELY APPEAL TO THE MAIN NEGATIVE CHARACTER OF THE TEXT IN RHETORICAL, CORRESPONDENCE DIALOGUE)), make films about your own, about your own - about fucking (tabu, sexual intercourse, copulation), about loot, about everything that makes up the meaning of the existence of your degenerative offspring, lick the Führer to bloody calluses on the tongue. You can even continue to engage in film mockery of the Strugatskys - this will in no way diminish the value of the books themselves. But you, bastard (rude-simple, bastard, scoundrel, bastard, traitor - THE SAME BAD FUNCTION), crap (simple, dirty MF) our war. INCREASING THE DEGREE OF CRITICISM WITH THE TRANSITION TO ECONOMIC AND SOCIO-IDEOLOGICAL TOPIC

6. I reveal the essence of the presentation (slang, claim, accusation). METATEXT - DEMONSTRATION OF REASONING For me and other Soviet (Russian) people, the Great Patriotic War is the cornerstone of historical consciousness, the most important element of national identity. THESIS Great nations were born in great battles: so Japan was accepted into the club of world powers only after Tsushima, Britain began to rule the world after Trafalgar, even small Israel proved its right to exist only by emerging victorious in a deadly battle with all its neighbors (you can not love the Jews , but after that it is impossible not to respect the Israelis). The apogee of the military, economic and spiritual prosperity of my country falls on the middle of the 20th century, and our power was unanimously recognized by the whole world, both friends and enemies, at the moment when the red flag fluttered over Berlin in the May wind. This was achieved with super effort, and a super price was paid for it. The war demanded from the nation such a spiritual intensity, in which, to put it abstrusely, our cultural matrix was smelted. To be Russian for me means * to realize my inextricable connection with those who wrote on the wall of the Reichstag the capacious "Stalingrad - Berlin. We've arrived!" and connection with those whose bones were reached by those who could inscribe it. Yes, the children pissed off (simple, lose) the victory of their fathers, but as long as the carriers (custodians) of the "Stalingrad-Berlin. We've arrived!" matrix remain, the nation has a chance for revival. ARGUMENTATION HISTORICAL, BY ANALOGY. PLUS THROUGH THE TOPOS OF CONNECTING WITH THE AUDIENCE (ours, ours...) plus through CONFESSIONAL TONALITY (“I am Russian”).
